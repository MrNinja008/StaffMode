# StaffMode
StaffMode is an all-in-one Pocketmine-MP (PMMP) moderation plugin made to simplify the life of staff members.

# Setup Guide
1. To start using the plugin, download the StaffMode.phar file from [poggit](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/StaffMode) and put it into your server's plugins folder. (IMPORTANT: If you do not know how to handle virions, do not download from github, the plugin will not work) 
2. Then, you have to do is set up your staff rank permissions. Look at the **Risk** tab in the following tables to decide which permissions is more suitable for which staff ranks to prevent possible abuse. It is recommended to give permissions with the *High* risk only to trusted staff members.
3. The `staffmode.command.staffmode` or `staffmode.*` permission is necessary in order for staff to enter staff mode.

| Permissions | Description | Default | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `staffmode.*` | Allows usage of all staffmode features. | `op` | High |
| `staffmode.command.staffmode` | Allows usage of the "/staffmode" command. | `op` | - |

4. The folowing permissions are to access the tools within staffmode.
